  matter the platform or size\*\* we will create a website that is not only easy
  to view but user friendly.

sec3-title: Website Visitor Behavior and <br>Trend Analysis Reports

  No matter how cool your site design may be, the meaning is lost if it is not
  being updated and improved to meet your visitors behavior and needs.  Just
  making changes without understanding what it is that needs changing does not
  help improve traffic.  But for places like a website, where you can't see the
  visitors faces, \*\*On what can you base your ideas for improving or enhancing
  your site?\*\*




  \- How many people actually visited your site yesterday?


  \- Where are your visitors from?


  \- Which pages on your site do people spend time on?


  \- What is the last place people look before they leave your site?




  From this kind of visitor generated data, it is possible for website owners to
  glean all kinds of important information on which decisions can be made. The
  most important step is analyzing this data and making it understandable;
  \*\*grasping what your visitor&apos;s are looking for and their behaviors\*\*.
  Based on this you can make meaningful changes to improve the effectiveness of
  your site.




  We at Jointanet will make all of this easier by providing a monthly digest
  report with analysis of the essential points you need to see; and offer advice
  about how we can improve traffic and website effectiveness.

  Even in this modern world, businesses still rely on person-to-person
  &quot;word-of-mouth&quot; interaction to broaden their scope and customer
  base.  Facebook and other social networks, if utilized properly, are great
  gathering places for this kind of promotion.  It is easy to put up a Facebook
  page or start a social networking account, but it remains difficult in making 
  it a useful promotional tool to broaden and improve your customer base.




  We will make sure to keep up with what is new in the world of social
  networking and make every effort to create a \*\*strong and interconnected
  WEBSITE-SNS presence\*\*
