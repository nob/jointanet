No matter how cool your site design may be, the meaning is lost if it is not being updated and improved to meet your visitors behavior and needs.  Just making changes without understanding what it is that needs changing does not help improve traffic.  But for places like a website, where you can't see the visitors faces, **On what can you base your ideas for improving or enhancing your site?**

- How many people actually visited your site yesterday?
- Where are your visitors from?
- Which pages on your site do people spend time on?
- What is the last place people look before they leave your site?

From this kind of visitor generated data, it is possible for website owners to glean all kinds of important information on which decisions can be made. The most important step is analyzing this data and making it understandable; **grasping what your visitor&apos;s are looking for and their behaviors**. Based on this you can make meaningful changes to improve the effectiveness of your site.

We at Jointanet will make all of this easier by providing a monthly digest report with analysis of the essential points you need to see; and offer advice about how we can improve traffic and website effectiveness.
