Moreover this event is open to the public 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. Although percentages vary with age and place, this gathering spot boasts participants of about 25 million people in Japan and over 1.79 billion people worldwide who come to meet, chat, discover and share.\n\nThis event offers grand opportunities for any and all businesses to introduce and shake hands with an amazing number of people. Why not get a \"booth\" at this grand event? If you haven't already opened an account and started a Facebook page, the time is now! Start sharing your business's products and services with visitors who come to the world's largest meeting and market place.\n<br/><br/>\n**But danger lies in thinking that just because you opened a page people will come and your message will be heard. Don't become dependent on Facebook to drive your important message.**\n<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n\n\n###Create a Internet Presence with Your Own Domain\nIt is important to keep in mind that your business Facebook page is nothing more than space/booth rented for free on a huge Internet event called Facebook. This event run has constantly changing administrative policies and rules decided by the management, i.e.Facebook. And, as long as you are borrowing a space there you must constantly follow these changes and adapt your page accordingly.\n\nEven after periods of amazing rapid growth, Facebook continues to grow and expand. And although it may be hard to imagine, there may be a day soon where it looses impact, breaks apart, or morphs into something different.\n\nBesides having this space/booth on Facebook, it is essential for you to create a Internet presence that is truly your own. And that can only be done by building, setting up and controlling your own \"main store/office\" in the form of a domain with your business's name. By purchasing a domain and building your own \"main store/office\" you are free to publish and share your official information as you like, without control by others.
